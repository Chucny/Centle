only search results with a perfect match, like the first results on a search engine. It uses the followinf APIs: <br><strong>DuckDuckGo API<br>Wikipedia API<br>GDelt API<br>OpenLibrary API</strong><br>You may not search for any long questions, for example, you can search for <br>a website, a sport, person, an artist or an animal etc.
<br><strong>You can also make it use more APIs by modifying the JavaScript. This search engine does not need to reload the page and it uses the fetch() function to get the results from the API.<br>There is a bug that on some Linux systems, wont load the JavaScript or CSS because the files are inside of a ZIP file. Note that this is not my fault, and I cannot fix it. It mostly doesn't happen, but on some operative systems it does. If this happens, you can use the file that is named "debug.html". This will load the Centle Search engine correctly. The JS and CSS files are only made for making the project easier to read and modify. Note that if you want to send this project to someone (that uses Linux), send the Centle-Install file and it will do the job. Please comment if there's anything that I could do better!
